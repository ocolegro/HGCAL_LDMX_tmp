# PFCalEE

Geant4 simulation of a Si-base sampling calorimeter

Check https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/HGCalPerformanceStudiesWithG4

Geometry implementation is instantiated by detector versions in an enum - cf. src/DetectorConstruction.cc and src/SamplingSection.cc

A small ntuple is stored with the energy deposits - cf. src/EventAction.cc 

When changing the ttree content, adding homemade classes rather than
simple objects, the classes should be added to userlib. The dictionary
for root to understand the classes also need to be remade. Use "make
dictionary" before make, inside of userlib/. Follow instructions in
https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/Sandbox/AnnemarieMagnanSandbox
for what needs to be put in the homemade classes and makefile for root to
understand them (see also example in class userlib/include/HGCSSSimHit.hh).

## Setup the environment (SLC6)

source g4env.sh

## Compile

mkdir -p userlib/{lib,obj,bin} && cd userlib && make dictionary && make -j 5 && cd - && make -j 5

## Submit in parallel the runs submitProd.py
## use option -S to not submit automatically to batch queues
## use option -g to do particleGun (by opposition to hepmc file, see example below)
## in case of options conflicts, you can replace python submitProd.py by ./submitProd.py...

##example with particle gun:
##edit submitProd.py to set the energy loop to the values wanted.
## For loop is to generate several samples with same stat in parallel.
for i in `seq 0 5`; do python submitProd.py -s 1nd -q 2nd -t V00-00-00 -g -r ${i} -v 3 -m 0 -e /store/cmst3/group/hgcal/Geant4 -o ~/work/ntuples -d e- -n 2500; done

##example with hepmc file:
./submitProd.py -S -q 2nd -t V00-00-00 -f /afs/cern.ch/work/a/amagnan/CMSSW_6_2_0_SLHC8/src/UserCode/Gen2HepMC/test/VBFH_sel.dat  -v 20 -m 2 -e /store/cmst3/group/hgcal/Geant4 -o ~/work/ntuples -d VBFH -n 1000
